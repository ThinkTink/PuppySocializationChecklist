This project provides a checklist of ideas for socializing a puppy. It provides both a full checklist and a page to see a random idea from the checklist. New items can be added to the checklist and changes are saved to local storage. This app is built using Vue2, Vue Router, Vuetify for UI, and Vuex for state management. View it live at https://thinktink.github.io/PuppySocializationChecklist/.

Why socalization? It is important that puppies be exposed to a wide range of experiences. This allows them to learn not to fear new things and grow up to be a well adjusted dog. Socialization should slowly introduce one novel thing at a time to keep the experience positive, and use lots of treats!
